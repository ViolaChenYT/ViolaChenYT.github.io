title: Computational Genomics
---

I took the course computational genomics at Carnegie Mellon in Spring 2022 and consolidated my own notes from the part of lectures that were on the exam. 
I...narcissistically think that my notes were decent as they helped me to score pretty well on the exam :D

[Here](../documents/510notes.pdf) it is.
I will definitely revisit and make this better as I learn more and more about the various topics touched by this course.
