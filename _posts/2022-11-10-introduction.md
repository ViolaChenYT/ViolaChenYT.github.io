My Bucket list: (in no particular order)
- See the Northern light
- Have my own house
- Land an Axel on ice
- Run a sub-2 half-marathon
- Run a sub-4 marathon
- Get the Ph.D.
- Get a part-time job as a bartender
- Climb Mt. Everest
- Live in Japan or Germany for a year
- Play *Flower Dance* on harmonica
- Use *Beautiful in White* as the music for my wedding
- more TBD

I know some are easier than others and some require much more work, but please, allow me to dream, at least :)
