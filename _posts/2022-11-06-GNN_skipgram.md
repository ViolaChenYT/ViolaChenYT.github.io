title: Skip-gram method in graph representation learning
---

As part of my little adventure into learning more about machine learning, I have joined a journal club on graph neural network (GNN).
Here are my slides for the part I taught, which is mostly on skip-gram methods for graphs.

- slides for [skip-gram background](../documents/skip-gram.pdf)
- slides for [loss-function(I)](../documents/loss_function1.pdf)
- slides for [loss-function(II)](../documents/loss_function2.pdf)
- slides for [negative sampling](../documents/loss_function3.pdf)

<!-- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.
