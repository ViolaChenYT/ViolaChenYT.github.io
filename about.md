  Hey there! Welcome to my page! You can call me Viola or Yitao, either way is fine with me.
</p>

Place where an ordinary girl puts down some of her life :)

Lover of too many things, God, nature, music, painting, sports and games...

I get a *new toy* every month on average, the newest addition to my assets is a practice drum pad and I am living my teenage dream of becoming that cool drummer :D\\
that's if I don't count my new pair of marathon running shoe that's supposed to come soon...after double 11.

Sometimes code can be annoying, but they can be lovely, and I can't live without them

Believes that everyone should abide by the *SCS reasonable principle*
